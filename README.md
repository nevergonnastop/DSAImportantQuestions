### None of the content I own, these are just things I came across during my preparation and thought I would share and gather all in one place. One might thank me someday (:

- **My personal Leetcode**: [https://leetcode.com/u/notGonnaHappen/](https://leetcode.com/u/notGonnaHappen/)

- It's a personal guide to get into Data Structure and Algorithms (Developer Profile).
- Learning DSA from scratch takes a large amount of time; learning it strategically with proper strategies works best.
- I am attaching some links that will help you learn the same as I do.
- The approach is faster and requires your utmost practice. It focuses on concepts rather than just the number of questions solved.

## LANGUAGE SPECIFIC

- **C++ Quick Guide**: [Below]
- **Java**: It's easy-peasy (Pass by value and reference data type). I have attached some really quality resources below to get you started. Good luck!
